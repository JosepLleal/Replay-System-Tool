# ACE Replay System 

ACE Replay is a simple state-based replay system. It was developed to quickly add replays to your game without the need to program anything. It includes two example scenes to show its utilities.

ACE Replay system only supports the record of transforms,  animations, audios, and particles, as well as the handling of instantiated and deleted objects. Keep in mind that this tool was done by a single person and was my final bachelorâ€™s degree project, so I was time-limited.

The user can customize the replay duration, to use or not the interpolation optimization, and the recording intervals.

At the moment of the release, the replay is only suited for 3D games.
